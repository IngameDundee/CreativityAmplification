# Creativity Amplification

*A collection of tools, processes, experiments and case studies to aid writers wanting to work with technology.*

You can find all relevant documentation on the wiki. PDF versions of all wiki information are available in this repository along with downloadable versions of all game projects. The wiki contains links to playable versions of game projects where possible. 

## Background

This work arises out of [InGAME’s](https://www.innovationforgames.com/) ongoing ‘Narrative and Play’ research theme. The underlying principle of this theme is the concept of ‘Creativity Amplification’, which builds on Vernor Vinge’s (1993) definition of ‘Intelligence Amplification’. This is the idea that rather than solely striving to create machines which are intelligent, we may also use technology to amplify our own intelligence. In applying this idea to writers and creativity, this research strand considers not how to make technologies creative in and of themselves, but instead how to extend and enhance individuals’ creativity through the use of appropriate processes and technologies.

### Background Research

The research in these toolkits also resulted in the academic papers [“Euphonia: Reflecting on the Design of an AI-Powered Narrative Game”](https://doi.org/10.1145/3383668.3419913) (Clark et al 2020), “Towards Creativity Amplification” (Clark 2021), [“Mechanical Oracles: Writing for Talking Machines” (Clark 2021)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkstioADojU).
